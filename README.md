# 2022 Advent of Code Solutions
As a personal challenge, I'm trying to solve every [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problem in a single line of Python code. No, my solutions are not optimal. Nor readable. Nor useful in any other way. But it's fun, so here we go!

day-xx.py files are my first solution attempts that form the backbone for my [one-line-solutions](https://github.com/savbell/2022-Advent-of-Code/blob/master/one-line-solutions.py) â€” see them to understand my blasphemous lines. [The Beast](https://github.com/savbell/2022-Advent-of-Code/blob/master/the-beast.py) combines them all to solve Days 1-11 in a single, slightly-more-condensed print statement. Please forgive me.

I've also created a visualization to show how many characters in The Beast are used to solve each day/part as of Day 10! [Check it out here.](https://github.com/savbell/2022-Advent-of-Code/blob/master/visualizations/length-of-the-beast-day-10.png)

Potential employers: I promise my production code is much, much better than this. Please don't blacklist me :(
